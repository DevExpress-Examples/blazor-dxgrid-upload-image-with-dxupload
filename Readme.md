### DataGrid for Blazor - How to use DxUpload inside a DxDataGrid's edit form to edit a field

The Data Grid was moved to maintenance support mode. No new features/capabilities will be added to this component. We recommend that you [migrate](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/403162/grid/migrate-from-data-grid-to-grid) to the [Grid](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/403143/grid) component. 

This example illustrates how to upload a new image using the DxUpload component, save it to the server's folder and save the path to the corresponding image in the edited grid's row.
